# Han Chinese Surnames Dataset


## Introduction
### Why this topic is interesting to me:
My motivation for exploring this topic came from the Data Is Plural — Structured Archive spreadsheet that my Computer Science teacher gave us for a project. A Han Chinese surnames dataset caught my eye. I have always beeen interested in names, such as their popularity, etymology, and history. I used to religiously look up name on websites such as Baby Name Wizard. However, I've always known that my name was never quite the same my classmates'. My parents gave me an American first name, but both my middle and last name are Chinese, with my middle name doubling as my Chinese name, because middle names in Chinese are nonexistent and my parents wanted my Chinese name to be part of my legal name. 

Chinese names reflect the wishes and expectations parents have for their children. My Chinese name/middle name, 天睿, means heavenly wisdom. My older sister's 天慧, bears a similar meaning. My parent's probably patted themselves on their backs for coming up with two names that not only rhymed, but also when romanized differ only by one letter. 

However patrarchy is rooted in Chinese culture, like most parts of the world, and affects how Chinese parents name their children. Men were often given more oppurtunities than woman, and the expecation for them to be dominant and smart is often reflected in their names. For example, my mom's name, 小杰, means small excellence. I remember being a little shocked when she explained that her parents wanted to give her a name that was "approproate for a woman". In other words, she was to be succesful, but not too successful. That idea is not something that would typically be put on a man. This made me curious to see if positive traits were associated with boy's names. higher name competence/assertiveness, name warmth/morality, and name valence ratings
