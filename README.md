# Han Chinese Surnames Dataset


## Introduction
### Why this topic is interesting to me:
My motivation for exploring this topic came from the Data Is Plural â€” Structured Archive spreadsheet that my Computer Science teacher gave us for a project. I was planning on choosing a dataset randomely because I didn't want to spend too much time deliberating it, and I randomely scrolled to a dried deans dataset which I was planning on using. However, a Han Chinese surnames dataset caught my eye, and I was lucky that it did because it happened to be a topic I have been interested in for a while! I have always beeen interested in names, such as their popularity, etymology, and history. I used to religiously look up name on websites such as Baby Name Wizard. However, I've also always known that my name was never quite the same as the names of my classmates. My parents gave me an American first name, but both my middle and last name are Chinese, with my middle name doubling as my Chinese name, because middle names in Chinese are nonexistent and my parents wanted my Chinese name to be part of my legal name.
